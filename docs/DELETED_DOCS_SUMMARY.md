# Documentation Deletion Summary

This report details the Markdown files that were deleted as part of the documentation overhaul initiated on 2025-11-24. The primary goal of this initiative was to unify the project's documentation around a single, cohesive vision outlined in the `UNIFIED_VISION.md` and `docs/ECONOMIC_MODEL.md`.

The following files were removed because they were either redundant, outdated, or directly contradicted by the new strategic direction.
