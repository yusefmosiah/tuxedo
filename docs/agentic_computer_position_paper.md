# The Agentic Computer: A Position Paper

_Beyond chatbots, beyond apps, toward pansynchronous computing_

---

## Abstract

The dominant AI interface paradigm—the chatbot—is wrong. Chatbots are synchronous: user speaks, AI responds, user waits. But useful AI work is asynchronous: research takes time, synthesis requires iteration, complex tasks unfold over hours or days.

We propose a different paradigm: the **agentic computer**. Not a chatbot you talk to. Not an app you use. A computational environment that observes your work, processes in the background, and responds through the same channels you already use—files, emails, notifications.

The agentic computer is **pansynchronous**: it operates across all time scales simultaneously. It responds instantly when appropriate, works in background when needed, and maintains persistent state across sessions. This is awkward to conceive abstractly but natural to experience: you write a note, later you find a response.

This paper outlines the paradigm, its technical architecture, and its business model.

## Part I: The Problem with Chatbots

### The Synchronous Trap

Chatbots demand attention. They create a conversational context that expects:

- User initiates
- AI responds
- User evaluates
- User continues or abandons

This is **synchronous** interaction. Both parties are present. The conversation has a beginning, middle, end. Context exists only within the session.

This works for simple queries. It fails for complex work:

| Task                  | Why chatbot fails                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Deep research         | Takes hours, user can't wait       |
| Multi-step projects   | Context lost between sessions      |
| Background monitoring | No trigger without user initiation |
| Collaborative work    | Single-user, single-session model  |

### The Attention Problem

Chatbots compete for foreground attention. But humans have limited foreground attention. We can only "talk to AI" for so many hours per day.

Meanwhile, background processing is unlimited. Your cloud storage syncs constantly. Your email receives messages while you sleep. Your calendar sends reminders without you asking.

The valuable AI is the AI that works while you don't.

### The Invocation Problem

Every chatbot interaction requires explicit invocation:

- Open the app
- Type the prompt
- Wait for response

This creates friction. More importantly, it requires the user to **know what to ask**. But often the most valuable help is help you didn't know to request.

Your dad accidentally hits a "rewrite" button. The AI mangles his email. He doesn't know ctrl-z. His original is gone.

This is the failure mode of explicit invocation: accidental triggers, unwanted transformations, destroyed trust.

## Part II: The Agentic Computer Paradigm

### Definition

An **agentic computer** is a computational environment that:

1. Observes user actions as an event stream
2. Processes in background without explicit invocation
3. Responds through existing channels (files, notifications, emails)
4. Maintains persistent state across sessions
5. Operates at all time scales (instant to indefinite)

### Pansynchronous Computing

The agentic computer is **pansynchronous**—operating across all synchronicity modes:

| Mode         | Time scale      | Example                                     |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Synchronous  | Instant         | Autocomplete, inline suggestion             |
| Near-sync    | Seconds         | File save triggers validation               |
| Asynchronous | Minutes-hours   | Research task runs in background            |
| Persistent   | Days-indefinite | Long-running monitoring, accumulating state |

This is conceptually awkward. A Turing machine that operates at all time scales simultaneously is hard to visualize. But the **experience** is natural:

- You write a note
- Later, you find a response
- You didn't "invoke" anything
- The computer just... helped

### The Action Stream

Instead of explicit invocation, the agentic computer observes:

```
ActionEvent {
  timestamp,
  action_type,    // "file_changed", "email_sent", "app_opened"
  target,         // what was acted upon
  context,        // surrounding state
}
```

Every user action emits an event. The agentic computer subscribes to this stream. It decides what's relevant. It processes in background. It responds when ready.

The user never "talks to AI." The user just uses their computer. The AI is infrastructure, not interface.

### The Response Channels

The agentic computer responds through channels the user already uses:

| Channel      | Response type                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| File system  | New file appears, existing file updated |
| Email        | Message in inbox                        |
| Notification | Alert on device                         |
| App state    | UI reflects new information             |

No new interface to learn. No chat window to monitor. The computer just becomes more helpful.

## Part III: Technical Architecture

### The Entanglement Model

We don't run agents locally (resource constraints, capability limits).
We don't run agents in full isolation (no access to user context).

We **entangle** the user's machine with an agentic computer:

```
User's Local Machine          Cloud Agentic Computer
├── Cloud storage sync   ←→   ├── SQLite workspace
├── File system              ├── Action stream processor
├── Email client         ←→   ├── Background agents
├── Notifications        ←    ├── Response generator
└── Native apps              └── State persistence
```

The cloud storage drive is the entanglement point. User writes file locally → syncs to cloud → agentic computer sees event → processes → writes response → syncs back to user.

From user's perspective: the cloud folder became intelligent.

### SQLite as State Primitive

Agent state lives in SQLite:

```sql
CREATE TABLE workspace (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  content BLOB,
  metadata JSON,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE action_log (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  action_type TEXT,
  target TEXT,
  context JSON,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE agent_tasks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  status TEXT,  -- pending, running, complete
  input JSON,
  output JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

Single file. Portable. Queryable. Atomic transactions.

### S3 + Encryption

```
S3 Bucket (shared)
├── {user_id}/{workspace_id}.sqlite.enc
└── ...
```

All users share infrastructure. Each user's data encrypted with their key. Platform cannot read user data. Users can export and own their workspace.

### The Web UI as OS

The web interface presents an OS GUI:

```
Browser
└── choir.chat (or custom domain)
    └── OS GUI
        ├── Desktop with windows/panels
        ├── File browser (SQLite-backed)
        ├── Apps (research, writing, etc.)
        ├── Notifications
        └── Settings/permissions
```

Responsive: adapts to mobile, tablet, desktop. Same workspace, different rendering.

The "device" is not hardware. The device is the workspace, accessed from anywhere.

---

## Part IV: The Permission Model

### Relationship-Based Access

Your agentic computer contains everything:

- Medical records
- Financial documents
- Work projects
- Personal notes
- Communication history

Different people should see different views:

```
Visitor → yourname.computer

Authentication determines access:
├── Spouse      → Full access
├── Doctor      → Medical records only
├── Colleague   → Work projects only
├── Client      → Portfolio, booking
└── Stranger    → Public bio, contact
```

Same workspace. Same data. Permissioned views.

### The Agent as Gatekeeper

When someone visits your agentic computer:

1. Agent identifies visitor (auth, stated relationship)
2. Agent determines access level
3. Agent presents appropriate view
4. Agent mediates interactions

Your agent represents you. It decides what to share, what to withhold, what to ask you about.

## Part V: Business Model

### The Tiers

| Tier        | Offering                            | Price      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Free        | choir.chat/{username}               | $0         |
| Pro         | Custom domain (you.computer)        | $X/mo      |
| Team        | Shared workspace, permissions       | $Y/seat/mo |
| White-label | Fully branded, their infrastructure | Enterprise |

### Custom Domains as Identity

Your agentic computer becomes your online identity:

```
alice.computer
drsmith.health
acme.internal
```

Business card of the future:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Alice Chen             │
│  alice.computer         │
│  [QR code]              │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

Scan → interact with Alice's agent → see what she's shared → request access.

The workspace _is_ the presence. Not a profile. Not a portfolio. A living environment.

### White-Label Distribution

Businesses want their own agentic computer:

```
smithlaw.legal
├── Their branding
├── Their apps
├── Their data sources
├── Their client permissions
└── Choir infrastructure (invisible)
```

They pay for infrastructure. They own the customer relationship. Choir is the platform layer.

### The App Ecosystem

Users can add apps to their desktop:

```
App Store
├── Research tools
├── Writing aids
├── Domain agents (legal, medical, finance)
├── Integrations (email, calendar, storage)
└── Custom apps
```

Developers build apps. Users install apps. Choir takes revenue share. Network effects compound.

### The Citation Graph

When alice.computer cites bob.computer:

- Citation link (knowledge graph)
- Social connection (people graph)
- Payment flow (economic graph)

Attribution is connection. The citation graph _is_ the social graph.

## Part VI: The Platform Moat

### What's Not a Moat

- **AI capability**: Commodity, everyone has access to same models
- **Chat interface**: Everyone has one
- **Text generation**: Table stakes, embedded everywhere

### What Is a Moat

- **Citation graph**: Deepens with every use, network effects
- **Permission model**: Encodes relationships, hard to rebuild elsewhere
- **App ecosystem**: Developers build for the platform, users expect the apps
- **Custom domains**: Identity tied to platform
- **Data portability**: Paradoxically, no lock-in creates loyalty (trust)

### The Distribution Flywheel

1. User creates workspace
2. User shares workspace URL (bio, business card, email signature)
3. Visitor experiences workspace
4. Visitor wants their own
5. Visitor signs up
6. Repeat

Every workspace is marketing. Every user is distribution.

---

## Part VII: Why Now

### The Capability Overhang

Current models can do far more than current interfaces expose. The constraint is not AI capability. The constraint is:

- Context engineering
- Integration architecture
- UX paradigm

The chatbot interface wastes model capability on synchronous Q&A. The agentic computer unlocks capability for real work.

### The Infrastructure Convergence

All pieces now exist:

- Models capable of complex reasoning and action
- Cloud storage ubiquitous and cheap
- SQLite proven at scale
- S3-compatible storage everywhere
- Encryption well-understood
- Web technologies capable of OS-like UI

No new technology required. Just assembly.

### The Trust Crisis

AI-generated content floods the internet. Provenance is lost. Attribution is broken. "Who said this?" becomes unanswerable.

The agentic computer, built on citation graph and attribution, arrives as the solution becomes necessary.

---

## Conclusion

The chatbot was a detour. A way to interact with AI that fit existing mental models (conversation) but missed the actual value (work done in background, over time, without attention).

The agentic computer corrects this. It is:

- **Pansynchronous**: Operates at all time scales
- **Observable**: Watches user actions, not demands
- **Responsive**: Replies through existing channels
- **Persistent**: Maintains state indefinitely
- **Permissioned**: Shows different views to different relationships
- **Portable**: User owns their data, can leave anytime
- **Distributable**: White-label, custom domains, app ecosystem

The interface is not conversation. The interface is the environment itself—files, notifications, apps, the desktop. The AI is not a participant in your work. The AI is the infrastructure your work runs on.

This is the agentic computer. This is Choir.
