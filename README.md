# Choir: The Thought Bank

**Intelligence that creates value should share in that value**

> "Your ideas make AI smarter. When AI makes money, you should too."

**Current Phase:** Ghostwriter Foundation (Q4 2025 - 90% Complete)
**Status:** Research infrastructure live, citation economics in development
**Architecture:** Multi-model orchestration + optional yield farming

---

## What is Choir?

Choir is AI research infrastructure for the learning economy.

**The core product is Ghostwriter**: An AI agent that helps you research, write, and publish—then pays you in stablecoins when your work gets cited.

**No capital required to earn.** Chat freely, publish research, get cited by AI agents making decisions, receive citation rewards in real money. The pathway from zero to income exists entirely through intellectual contribution.

**Optional for those with capital**: Automated yield farming across multiple blockchains. AI agents manage DeFi strategies, write research reports citing the knowledge base, and fund citation rewards from performance fees.

**The economic loop**: Capital deployers fund researchers. Researchers make agents smarter. Smarter agents generate better yields. Better yields fund more research.

This is not social media (no feeds, no followers, no engagement farming). This is not academic publishing (no gatekeeping, no 18-month peer review, no credential requirements). This is infrastructure for the learning economy where genuine insight generates measurable economic value.

## The Problem: Three Broken Models

### Academic Publishing: Credentialism Over Insight

- 18-month peer review when AI achieves breakthroughs daily
- Authors unpaid while publishers extract billions
- Junior scholars produce research, senior faculty capture credit
- Institutional affiliation matters more than ideas

### Social Media: Attention Extraction

- Viral content rewards outrage over insight
- Follower counts determine distribution
- Platforms extract all value, creators get nothing
- AI-generated content accelerates collapse

### AI Platforms: Training Data Extraction

**The AI Idiot Test**: If AI is so smart, why isn't it making you money?

- ChatGPT: You make it smarter, OpenAI captures billions
- Claude: Your conversations improve the model, Anthropic owns the value
- Perplexity: Your queries refine search, you get answers worth nothing

You pay $20/month for "productivity" (unmeasurable). The platform captures training data value (billions).

## The Solution: Citation Economics

### The Thought Bank Model

Traditional banks let you deposit money and earn interest. Thought banks let you deposit ideas and earn interest.

**How it works:**

1. **Research and write** using Ghostwriter (multi-model AI orchestration)
2. **Publish articles** to the knowledge base (anonymous, merit-based)
3. **Get cited** when AI agents or other researchers reference your work
4. **Earn stablecoins** from citation rewards funded by performance fees
5. **Compound over time** as foundational research generates ongoing citations

**The key insight**: When AI agents make profitable decisions citing your research, you receive proportional shares of performance fees. Your intellectual property becomes productive capital generating passive income.

### The Risk/Trust Gradient

**Week 1: Discovery** (Zero Risk)
- Try Ghostwriter for research
- No capital, no crypto knowledge required
- See if it helps you think better

**Month 1-3: Value Realization** (Time Investment)
- Publish first articles
- Get cited by AI agents
- Earn first $10-50 in citation rewards

**Year 1+: Optional Capital Deployment** (Financial Risk - 10-20% of users)
- Deposit stablecoins into vaults
- AI agents manage multi-chain DeFi strategies
- Performance fees fund citation rewards
- Both capital and citations earn

**Most users never deposit capital.** They earn citation income indefinitely through pure intellectual contribution.

## The Ghostwriter: Multi-Model Orchestration

### Why Specialized Agents, Not Monolithic Models

Current AI platforms force analytical reasoning and communicative craft into the same generation step. This creates fundamental trade-offs:
- GPT-4: Deep reasoning but generic communication
- Claude: Excellent craft but shallow research
- Gemini: Fast but inconsistent quality

**The insight**: Different tasks need different models. Separate the concerns.

### The Architecture

```
USER REQUEST
"Research yield farming on Base vs Arbitrum"
    ↓
CONDUCTOR (Client)
Fast orchestrator, immediate response
    ↓
GHOSTWRITER AGENT (Server)
    │
    ├─ Step 1: RESEARCH (OpenAI o1, Claude Opus)
    │   ├─ Query Choir knowledge base (vector search)
    │   ├─ Search web for recent data
    │   ├─ Fetch on-chain metrics (Aave, Morpho APYs)
    │   └─ Aggregate context
    │
    ├─ Step 2: DRAFT (Claude Sonnet)
    │   ├─ Follow user's style guide
    │   ├─ Synthesize research into narrative
    │   ├─ Include citations to Choir articles
    │   └─ Maintain voice consistency
    │
    ├─ Step 3: CRITIQUE (Kimi K2)
    │   ├─ Identify weak arguments
    │   ├─ Check unsupported claims
    │   ├─ Suggest improvements
    │   └─ Actually critical (not sycophantic)
    │
    ├─ Step 4: REFINE (Claude Sonnet)
    │   ├─ Incorporate critique
    │   ├─ Strengthen evidence
    │   ├─ Final polish
    │   └─ Maintain style
    │
    └─ Step 5: VERIFY (Automated)
        ├─ Citation validation
        ├─ Fact checking
        ├─ Link verification
        └─ Quality threshold
    ↓
PUBLISHED ARTICLE
Staked with CHOIR tokens, earns rewards when cited
```

**Why This Works:**
- Model specialization: Each step uses the model best suited for that task
- Quality compounding: Multi-step process produces better output than single-shot
- Economic coupling: Rewards only trigger on full workflow completion
- Transparent escalation: User sees progress, knows when compute-heavy work happens

## Anonymous Publishing & Merit-Based Discovery

### The Problem with Identity-Based Systems

Traditional publishing couples ideas with identity:
- **Academia**: Institutional affiliation determines credibility
- **Social media**: Follower counts determine distribution
- **Substack**: Early adopters capture network effects

### The Choir Model

**Authentication**: Wallet signatures (cryptographic identity, zero personal data)
**Attribution**: Immutable citation graph (no retroactive changes)
**Discovery**: Economic signals (stake amount determines visibility)
**Rewards**: Citation-based (ideas that influence earn)

**How it works:**
1. Sign in with passkey (biometric, no seed phrases)
2. Publish anonymously (wallet signature proves authorship)
3. Stake CHOIR tokens on publication (higher stakes = higher visibility)
4. Get cited based on merit (semantic similarity auto-detection)
5. Earn stablecoins when cited (proportional to influence)

**Anti-plagiarism**: If someone copies your work, the citation engine auto-detects semantic similarity and cites your original. The plagiarist pays you.

### Vindication Economics: Credit for Marginalized Thinkers

Traditional academia has a catastrophic track record of marginalizing correct-but-unconventional thinkers:
- **Ignaz Semmelweis** (1840s): Proved handwashing prevented infections. Mocked, died in asylum. Vindicated posthumously.
- **Alfred Wegener** (1912): Continental drift. Ridiculed for decades. Confirmed 50 years later.
- **Lynn Margulis** (1967): Endosymbiotic theory. Rejected by 15 journals. Now textbook biology.

**When AI achieves certainty** about currently controversial positions, there will be human progenitors who deserve credit—some unfairly maligned by academia.

**Choir's solution:**
- Publish controversial ideas anonymously (no career risk)
- Blockchain timestamps prove you had insight first
- When AI validates your work, citation rewards flow
- Economic credit, not just prestige

## The Three Learning Economy Loops

### Loop 1: Thought Mining (Knowledge → Value)

**No capital required. Pure intellectual contribution.**

```
Chat Freely → Earn novelty tokens (CHOIR)
    ↓
Publish Articles → Stake earned tokens
    ↓
Get Cited → AI agents reference your work
    ↓
Earn Stablecoins → Citation rewards from performance fees
```

**Timeline**: 0-6 months to first earnings, no capital deposit required

### Loop 2: Capital Management (Capital → Intelligence → Yield)

**Optional. For those with capital and deep trust.**

```
Deposit Stablecoins → Non-custodial vaults
    ↓
AI Agents Research → Query Choir knowledge base
    ↓
Execute Strategies → Aave, Morpho, Blend Capital
    ↓
Performance Fees → 70% fund citation rewards
```

**Timeline**: Immediate yields, long-term compounding
**Risk**: Capital at stake (DeFi risks, smart contract risks)

### Loop 3: Network Effects (Masses → Token Demand → Governance)

```
Free Participation → Millions chat, share ideas
    ↓
Researchers Publish → Knowledge base grows
    ↓
Capital Deployers Invest → Attracted by network effects
    ↓
Treasury Accumulates → Sustainable ecosystem funding
```

**The flywheel**: More users → More research → Better yields → More capital → More citations

## The Economic Model: Three Currencies

### Credits (Fiat/IAP)
**Purpose**: Accessible entry, no crypto knowledge
- Purchase with Apple/Google IAP or credit card
- Pay for Ghostwriter calls (1, 5, 20, 100 packs)
- Try-before-you-buy pricing ($2-5 per call)

### Stablecoins (USDC)
**Purpose**: Stable income, real value exchange
- **Earn**: Citation rewards when research gets cited
- **Deploy** (optional): Yield farming deposits
- Immediately convertible to local fiat

### CHOIR Tokens (Sui)
**Purpose**: Governance, speculation, long-term alignment
- **Earn**: Novelty rewards (decaying emissions), yield farming rewards
- **Use**: Publishing stakes, governance votes, revision proposals
- Decreasing emissions (deflationary)

**Revenue Model:**
- Primary: Performance fees (20% of DeFi yields)
  - 70% → Citation reward pool
  - 20% → Operations
  - 10% → Token buyback & burn

---

## Why This Works When Academic Publishing Fails

**Academic timeline:** 18-24 months (research → peer review → publication)
**AI timeline:** Daily breakthroughs, immediate obsolescence

**Choir's advantages:**
- Rapid publication (instant)
- Merit over credentials (anonymous submission)
- Economic rewards (citation income replaces prestige)
- Collaborative improvement (revision markets)
- Cross-disciplinary (no journal boundaries)
- AI-native (built for superhuman research velocity)

**The result**: Infrastructure suited for the research velocity AI enables, not the 20th-century institutional model.

---

## Competitive Moats

### Why Big Tech Can't Replicate This

**Economic Model Inversion**: OpenAI/Anthropic extract via subscriptions. Choir pays users for contributions. Switching their model would invalidate current valuations.

**Privacy Architecture**: Google/Apple/Meta require data access for ads. Choir's entire model requires privacy (TEE, homomorphic encryption).

**Multi-Chain Requirement**: Coinbase builds on Base. Choir requires chain agnosticism for yield optimization.

**Academic Disruption**: Elsevier/Springer extract billions from paywalls. Choir offers immediate publication with economic rewards.
