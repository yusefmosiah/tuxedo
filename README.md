# Choir: The Thought Bank

**Your ideas make AI smarter. When AI makes money, you should too.**

## What is Choir?

Choir is a "marketplace of ideas" with a revolutionary economic model: **principal protection + asymmetric upside.**

*   **Deposit USDC to Participate**: To get started, you deposit USDC. This isn't a fee; it's your stake in the ecosystem.
*   **Your Principal is Safe**: You can withdraw your full principal deposit after an initial lockup period. You cannot lose your initial capital.
*   **Earn Ownership Through Ideas**: Your "yield" is paid in **CHIP (Choir Harmonic Intelligence Platform)** tokens. The amount of CHIP you earn is based entirely on the **semantic novelty** of the content you publish, not the size of your deposit.
*   **Earn Income Through Quality**: When your published work is cited by others, you earn **USDC**, paid from a sustainable, exponentially-scaling rewards pool.

This creates a true meritocracy. A researcher with a small deposit who publishes groundbreaking work will earn far more ownership (CHIP) and income (USDC) than a wealthy, passive participant.

## The Economic Flywheel

Choir's economy is designed to be self-sustaining and to reward contribution.

1.  **Deposits Fund Operations**: The *yield* from all user USDC deposits funds the protocol's core operational budget (development, security, etc.).
2.  **Novelty Earns CHIP**: The Treasury distributes a fixed supply of CHIP tokens to users who publish novel research. As the platform's knowledge base grows, novelty becomes harder to achieve, creating a natural, emergent decay in CHIP emissions.
3.  **Usage Builds the Treasury**: CHIP is consumed to use platform features (e.g., publishing). This consumed CHIP flows directly to the Choir Treasury, which accumulates a massive portfolio of its own token.
4.  **Treasury Funds Citations**: The Treasury borrows USDC against its CHIP holdings from the user deposit pool. This borrowed capital funds the citation rewards pool, creating an exponentially scaling budget to reward high-quality research.

This is a **positive-sum ecosystem**. It is not extractive. It does not rely on performance fees or buybacks. The network's own growth, fueled by intellectual contribution, directly funds the rewards for that contribution.

## Getting Started

The core product is **Ghostwriter**: a multi-model AI agent that helps you research, write, and publish high-quality, citable work.

A **free tier** provides starter CHIP credits, allowing you to publish your first articles, earn your first USDC from citations, and then use those earnings to make your first deposit. The pathway from zero to income exists entirely through intellectual contribution.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Ghostwriter Foundation (Q4 2025)

The core research infrastructure is live. The citation economics and CHIP distribution mechanics are in active development.
