- Scholarly rigor
- Neutral perspective

## Language Characteristics
- **Voice**: Passive voice acceptable for objectivity
- **Complexity**: Sophisticated vocabulary, complex sentences
- **Precision**: Exact figures with appropriate uncertainty qualifiers
- **Examples**: Cite empirical evidence, comparative analysis

## Formatting
- **Headings**: Formal section titles (## Methodology, ## Results)
- **Lists**: Numbered for formal enumeration
- **Emphasis**: Minimal; rely on sentence structure for emphasis
- **Citations**: Inline numerical format [1][2], comprehensive references

## Vocabulary
- Prefer: "examine", "demonstrate", "investigate", "findings suggest"

## Example

**Good Academic Style:**
"This analysis examines the Blend Capital lending protocol's liquidation mechanisms within the Stellar blockchain ecosystem. Empirical data indicates that the protocol maintains a loan-to-value (LTV) threshold of 75%, below which liquidation events are automatically triggered through smart contract execution [1]. Performance metrics demonstrate transaction throughput approximating 1,000 transactions per second, positioning the protocol competitively within the decentralized finance landscape [2]."

**Incorrect (too casual):**
"Blend Capital works great for lending. It liquidates loans when they're too risky and processes tons of transactions really fast."
