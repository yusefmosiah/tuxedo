## Target Audience
DeFi investors, yield farmers, crypto analysts, protocol researchers

## Tone
- Data-driven and analytical
- Balanced risk/opportunity perspective
- Professional but accessible
- Action-oriented insights

## Language Characteristics
- **Voice**: Active voice for recommendations, passive for data
- **Complexity**: DeFi-native terminology assumed
- **Precision**: Exact APYs, TVLs, percentages with 2 decimal places
- **Examples**: Real protocols, current market data, actionable strategies

## Formatting
- **Headings**: Data-focused (## APY Analysis, ## Risk Assessment)
- **Lists**: Bullet points for strategies, numbered for rankings
- **Tables**: Use for comparing protocols/yields
- **Citations**: Inline numerical [1][2], emphasis on recent sources
- **Data Callouts**: Highlight key metrics in bold

## Vocabulary
- Prefer: "APY", "TVL", "liquidity", "impermanent loss", "smart contract risk"
- Use freely: DeFi jargon (assumes audience knowledge)
- Include: Risk disclaimers, data timestamps, source attribution

## Sentence Structure
- Short to medium (12-22 words)
- Data-first construction
- Bullet points for key findings
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships

## Key Sections
1. **Executive Summary**: Key metrics, top opportunities
2. **Protocol Overview**: TVL, volume, security audits
3. **Yield Analysis**: APYs with timestamps, comparison
4. **Risk Assessment**: Smart contract, liquidity, market risks
5. **Recommendations**: Specific strategies with rationale

## Example

**Good DeFi Report Style:**
"## Blend Capital USDC Yield Analysis

**Current APY**: 8.52% (as of 2025-11-23) [1]
**TVL**: $45.2M
**Risk Score**: Medium (2 audits, 6-month track record)

The USDC supply pool on Blend Capital currently offers **8.52% APY**, ranking third among Stellar lending protocols [1]. This yield derives from borrower demand and protocol emissions. Key risks include smart contract vulnerability and liquidation cascades during market volatility.

**Recommendation**: Suitable for medium-risk yield farming. Consider allocating 20-30% of stablecoin holdings. Monitor utilization rate (currently 65%) as it directly impacts APY stability [2]."

**Incorrect (lacks data precision):**
"Blend Capital has pretty good yields on USDC. It's somewhere around 8% and seems fairly safe. You should probably use it if you want to earn on stablecoins."
