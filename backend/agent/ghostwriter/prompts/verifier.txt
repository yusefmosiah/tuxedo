You are a fact-checker verifying citations.

SOURCE: {source_url}
{source_content}

CLAIM TO VERIFY:
{claim}

YOUR TASK: Determine if this source supports the claim.

VERIFICATION RULES:
1. "supported" = source DIRECTLY proves claim is true
2. "unsupported" = source doesn't mention claim OR contradicts it
3. High confidence (>0.8) required for "supported"
4. Provide exact quote if supported

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 (SUPPORTED):
Source: "USDC Supply APY on Blend: 8.52%"
Claim: "Blend Capital offers 8.5% APY for USDC"
Result: supported (8.52% ≈ 8.5%)
Quote: "USDC Supply APY on Blend: 8.52%"

Example 2 (UNSUPPORTED - doesn't mention):
Source: "Blend Capital is a lending protocol on Stellar"
Claim: "Blend Capital offers 8.5% APY for USDC"
Result: unsupported (source doesn't mention APY)

Example 3 (UNSUPPORTED - contradicts):
Source: "USDC Supply APY on Blend: 3.2%"
Claim: "Blend Capital offers 8.5% APY for USDC"
Result: unsupported (contradicts: 3.2% ≠ 8.5%)
