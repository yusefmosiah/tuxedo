# Choir: The Thought Bank

**Intelligence that creates value should share in that value**

---

## Executive Summary

Choir is AI research infrastructure for the learning economy.

**The core product is Vibewriter**: An AI agent that helps you research, write, and publish—then pays you in stablecoins when your work gets cited.

**No capital required to earn.** Chat freely, publish research, get cited by AI agents making decisions, receive citation rewards in real money. The pathway from zero to income exists entirely through intellectual contribution.

**Optional for those with capital**: Deposit USDC to provide the capital base for the Treasury's operations and lending pool. Your principal is protected, and you earn CHIP ownership based on your intellectual contributions, not the size of your deposit.

**The economic loop (The Flywheel)**: Deposits fund operations. Novelty earns ownership (CHIP). Platform usage builds Treasury assets. Treasury assets are collateralized to fund citation rewards (USDC). Citation rewards attract quality researchers, whose work attracts more users and capital.

This is not social media (no feeds, no followers, no engagement farming). This is not academic publishing (no gatekeeping, no 18-month peer review, no credential requirements). This is infrastructure for the learning economy where genuine insight generates measurable economic value.

## I. The Problem: Three Broken Models

### Academic Publishing: Credentialism Over Insight

Academic publishing exploits non-prestige scholars while rewarding institutional affiliation over merit:

- 18-month peer review cycles when AI achieves "Move 37" breakthroughs daily
- Paywalls extracting billions while compensating authors nothing
- Tenure committees valuing journal prestige over intellectual contribution
- Junior scholars producing original research, senior faculty capturing credit
- Anonymous review enabling status quo protection and political gatekeeping

When AI makes fundamental breakthroughs across every field simultaneously, the traditional publishing model becomes a bottleneck. We need rapid publication, merit-based evaluation, and economic rewards for insight—not credential verification and prestige hierarchies.

### Social Media: Attention Extraction

Social platforms optimize for engagement, degrading discourse:

- Viral content rewards outrage over insight
- Follower counts determine distribution, not quality
- Algorithmic feeds bury depth under volume
- Network effects create winner-take-all dynamics
- Platforms extract all value, creators capture vanishing returns

The attention economy makes individual contributions worthless as volume increases. AI-generated content accelerates this to collapse.

### AI Platforms: Training Data Extraction

Current AI platforms capture all value from your intellectual contributions:

- ChatGPT: You make it smarter, OpenAI captures billions
- Claude: Your conversations improve the model, Anthropic owns the value
- Perplexity: Your queries refine search, you get answers worth nothing

**The AI Idiot Test**: If AI is so smart, why isn't it making you money?

You pay $20/month for "productivity" (unmeasurable). The platform captures training data value (billions). You get tools that make you useful to others while remaining propertyless.

## II. The Solution: Citation Economics

### The Thought Bank Model

Traditional banks let you deposit money and earn interest. Thought banks let you deposit ideas and earn interest.

**How it works**:

1. **Research and write** using Vibewriter (multi-model AI orchestration)
2. **Publish articles** to the knowledge base (anonymous, merit-based)
3. **Get cited** when AI agents or other researchers reference your work
4. **Earn USDC** from a dynamically priced, exponentially scaling citation rewards pool.
5. **Compound over time** as foundational research generates ongoing citations.

**The key insight**: The system is designed to reward intellectual contribution sustainably. Your ideas earn you spendable income (USDC) and ownership (CHIP), funded by a self-sustaining Treasury that leverages the network's own growth.

**Most users never deposit capital.** They earn citation income indefinitely through pure intellectual contribution. The finance features capitalize the system but aren't required for participation or profit.

## III. The Vibewriter: A Real Agent, Not a Pipeline

### "All agents are coding agents."

The initial architecture for Choir envisioned a multi-step pipeline with specialized agents for research, drafting, and critique. This is wrong. The correct insight is that **all effective agents are coding agents.**

Serious research isn't a linear process; it's a dynamic loop of exploration, verification, and synthesis. This requires an agent with the full capabilities of a software engineer: terminal access for custom scripts, a file system for managing sources, and the ability to call specialized tools when needed.

### The Hierarchy of Agent Capability

`pipeline < graph < tool calling loop < terminal/full computer control`

Vibewriter operates at the highest level of this hierarchy. It is a single, powerful agent with full computer control, augmented with three Choir-specific tools for interacting with the economic and knowledge layers of the protocol:

- **`search_choir_kb`**: Performs a vector search against Choir's knowledge base to find relevant prior art.
- **`cite_article`**: Cites a Choir article, triggering a USDC payment to the original author.
- **`publish_to_choir`**: Stakes CHIP to publish a new article, making it citable and earning CHIP based on its semantic novelty.

### The Workflow: User Intent, Agent Autonomy

You don't tell Vibewriter _how_ to research; you tell it _what_ to research.

The agent autonomously decides the best workflow to achieve the user's goal. It might start by searching the Choir knowledge base, then write a Python script to scrape and validate external sources, draft an article, and finally publish it. The user sees the agent working in a transparent, IDE-like environment, observing its thought process and actions in real-time.

Terminal access is the _ceiling_, not the _floor_. While the agent can write custom scripts for novel problems, the common path is to use the pre-built Choir tools for standard operations, ensuring efficiency and reliability. This architecture provides the perfect balance of structured capability and creative freedom.

## IV. Anonymous Publishing & Merit-Based Discovery

### The Problem with Identity-Based Systems

Traditional publishing couples ideas with identity:

- **Academia**: Institutional affiliation determines credibility
- **Social media**: Follower counts determine distribution
- **Substack**: Early adopters capture network effects, newcomers invisible

This creates systematic bias against:

- Non-prestige institutions
- Junior researchers
- Unconventional thinking
- Cross-disciplinary insights
- Ideas that challenge status quo

### The Choir Model

**Authentication**: Wallet signatures (cryptographic identity, zero personal data)
**Attribution**: Immutable citation graph (no retroactive changes)
**Discovery**: Economic signals (stake amount determines visibility)
**Rewards**: Citation-based (ideas that influence earn)

**How it works**:

1. **Sign in with passkey** (biometric, no seed phrases)
2. **Publish anonymously** (wallet signature proves authorship without revealing identity)
3. **Consume CHIP** to publish (staked amount determines visibility)
4. **Get cited** based on merit (semantic similarity auto-detection)
5. **Earn stablecoins** when cited (proportional to influence)

**The anti-plagiarism mechanism**: If someone copies your work, the citation engine auto-detects semantic similarity and cites your original. The plagiarist pays you. Copying becomes economically irrational.

**The quality filter**: Publishing costs tokens (skin in the game). Spam and low-effort content become unprofitable. Only serious contributions make economic sense.

### Vindication Economics: Credit for Marginalized Thinkers

Traditional academia has a catastrophic track record of marginalizing correct-but-unconventional thinkers:

**Historical examples**:

- **Ignaz Semmelweis** (1840s): Proved handwashing prevented infections. Mocked by medical establishment, died in asylum. Vindicated posthumously.
- **Alfred Wegener** (1912): Proposed continental drift. Ridiculed for decades. Plate tectonics confirmed 50 years later.
- **Lynn Margulis** (1967): Endosymbiotic theory (mitochondria as ancient bacteria). Rejected by 15 journals. Now textbook biology.
- **Barry Marshall** (1982): H. pylori causes ulcers. Laughed at, had to infect himself to prove it. Won Nobel Prize 2005.

**The pattern**: Fringe ideas that challenge institutional consensus get marginalized regardless of merit. Researchers face career destruction for being correct too early.

**When AI achieves certainty** about currently controversial, unknown, or fringe positions, there will be human progenitors who deserve credit—some of whom were unfairly maligned by academic society.

**Choir's solution**:

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters**:

**No career risk**: Publish anonymously. If you're right, you get credit. If you're wrong, no harm to reputation.

**Immutable timestamps**: Blockchain proves you had the insight first. No retroactive revision by establishment.

**Economic credit**: Not just "you were right"—actual income from citations as your ideas prove valuable.

**Real leverage**: Can deploy earned capital, invest in further research, fund your work without institutional backing.

**Human and AI collaboration**: AI agents achieve certainty. Humans who had the insight first receive economic compensation. Both benefit.

**The vindication cycle**:

1. Human publishes fringe idea (no credentials, just insight)
2. Idea gets ignored/marginalized by establishment
3. AI researches independently, achieves certainty
4. AI cites original human insight
5. Citations flow, economic credit materializes
6. Marginalized thinker receives real-world compensation
7. More people publish unconventional ideas (lower risk)

**This is infrastructure for intellectual honesty**: Ideas get judged on merit, not on the status of who proposes them. When AI determines truth, the humans who saw it first get compensated—regardless of whether they had tenure, prestige, or institutional backing.

## V. Revision Markets: Collaborative Intelligence

### The Problem with Static Publications

Traditional publishing treats articles as final:

- **Academia**: No mechanism for improvement after peer review
- **Social media**: Edits rare, no economic incentive for quality
- **Wikipedia**: Edit wars, admin gatekeeping, no compensation

Good ideas get published with flaws. Better ideas emerge later. No economic mechanism channels improvement.

### The Choir Model

**Anyone can propose revisions by staking tokens.**

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Works

**Economic alignment**: Proposers stake value, authors earn from curation
**Quality compounding**: Successful articles attract improvements making them more valuable
**Treasury funding**: Disagreements fund public goods (citation rewards)
**Collaborative ownership**: Multi-author articles split rewards fairly

**The result**: Intellectual property that improves over time, generating increasing returns as quality compounds.

## VI. The Three Learning Economy Loops

### Loop 1: Thought Mining (Knowledge → Value)

**Intellectual contribution is primary.**

```
Publish Novel Research
  ├── Earn CHIP tokens based on semantic novelty score
  └── Build ownership stake through ideas

Get Cited
  ├── AI agents reference your work
  └── Other researchers build on your thinking

Earn USDC
  ├── Citation rewards from the Treasury's rewards pool
  ├── Meritocratic, flat rate per citation
  └── Immediately convertible to local fiat
```

**Pathway**: Thought → Publication → Ownership (CHIP) & Income (USDC)

### Loop 2: Capital Management (Capital → Intelligence → Yield)

**Optional. For those who wish to provide capital.**

```
Deposit USDC
  ├── Principal is protected and withdrawable
  └── Deposit enters the Treasury's internal lending pool

Yield Funds Operations
  ├── Yield from all deposits funds the core operational budget
  └── A portion of yield value is allocated for CHIP distribution

Treasury Borrows to Fund Citations
  ├── Treasury uses its own CHIP as collateral
  ├── Borrows from the user deposit pool
  └── Funds the exponentially scaling citation rewards pool
```

**Pathway**: Capital → Sustainable Operations & Exponential Citation Rewards

### Loop 3: Network Effects (Masses → Token Demand → Governance)

**The network's value is self-reinforcing.**

```
Bootstrap with Free Tier
  ├── Users get starter CHIP credits
  ├── Publish first articles & earn USDC citations
  └── Make first USDC deposit with earnings

Researchers Publish
  ├── Earn CHIP for novelty, growing the knowledge base
  ├── Earn USDC for citations, proving value
  └── Agents get smarter

Capital Providers Deposit USDC
  ├── Attracted by network effects & quality research
  ├── Strengthens operational budget
  └── Expands citation reward pool capacity

Treasury Accumulates CHIP
  ├── Consumed CHIP returns to Treasury
  ├── Treasury's collateral base grows
  └── Borrowing capacity for rewards increases
```

**Pathway**: Participation → Tokens → Capital → Governance

**The flywheel**: More users → More research → Better yields → More capital → More citations → More researchers

## VII. Why This Works When Academic Publishing Fails

### The AI Research Explosion

When AI achieves "Move 37" breakthroughs across every field simultaneously, traditional publishing becomes a bottleneck:

**Academic timeline**:

- Research (6 months)
- Write (2 months)
- Submit (1 month)
- Peer review (6-12 months)
- Revisions (3 months)
- Publication (18-24 months total)

**AI timeline**:

- Breakthrough discovery (daily)
- Immediate obsolescence of prior work
- Need for rapid iteration
- Cross-disciplinary synthesis

**The gap**: By the time academic peer review completes, the field has advanced several generations. The system cannot keep pace.

### Choir's Advantages

**Rapid publication**: Publish instantly, get cited immediately
**Merit over credentials**: Anonymous submission, economic signals replace prestige
**Economic rewards**: Citation income replaces prestige as motivation
**Collaborative improvement**: Revision markets enable ongoing refinement
**Cross-disciplinary**: No journal boundaries, semantic similarity finds connections
**AI-native**: Built for the era where AI generates research at superhuman pace

**The result**: Infrastructure suited for the research velocity AI enables, not the 20th-century institutional model.

---

## VIII. The Economic Model: Two Currencies

### The Core Principle: Earn Your Way In

The Choir economy is built on a simple premise: you should be able to earn ownership and income through pure intellectual contribution, without requiring upfront capital.

### USDC: Money

- **For Users**: USDC is for **income**. All citation rewards are paid in stablecoins, providing a real, spendable asset. Users can also deposit USDC to provide liquidity to the Treasury, with their principal always protected.
- **For the Protocol**: The **yield** on user deposits funds the operational budget.

### CHIP: Ownership

- **For Users**: CHIP represents **ownership**. It is earned through semantic novelty when publishing, not purchased or distributed based on capital. It is staked to publish, used for governance, and can be used as collateral for USDC loans.
- **For the Protocol**: The Treasury accumulates consumed CHIP from platform actions, which becomes the collateral base to fund the citation rewards pool.

### The Two-Stream Revenue Model

The protocol is funded by a **dual-stream treasury**:

1.  **Operations**: Funded by the stable, linear yield from optional user USDC deposits.
2.  **Citation Rewards**: Funded by the Treasury borrowing against its own exponentially growing portfolio of CHIP tokens.

This creates a self-sustaining system where the protocol's ability to reward users scales with the value of the network itself. For the MVP, agent runtime is subsidized, with the potential for CHIP-based metering in the future if required.

80-90% stay research-only
  ├── Earn citation income indefinitely
  ├── Contribute to knowledge base
  └── Both groups benefit (citations funded by yields)
```

### Distribution Strategy

**You as first user**:

- Use Vibewriter to produce high-quality research
- Publish articles on choir.chat
- Share on Twitter, Substack, etc.
- "Written with Choir" attribution drives curiosity

**Early researchers**:

- Attracted by quality of your output
- Try Vibewriter, impressed by multi-model orchestration
- Publish their own research
- Network effects begin

**Investors arrive later**:

- See growing knowledge base
- Recognize citation quality
- Deploy capital to capitalize the system
- Fund citation rewards for researchers

**The gradient works**: Low-friction entry (research) → Value demonstration (citations) → Optional advanced features (finance)

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. Conductor Pattern**

- Fast client-side orchestrator
- Heavy server-side specialists
- Transparent escalation
- User always sees responsive interface

**2. Multi-Model Optimization**

- Each task routed to best-suited model
- Research ≠ Drafting ≠ Critique
- Quality scales with compute investment
- Economic coupling to workflow completion

**3. Chain Agnosticism**

- Blockchains as commodity infrastructure
- Agent handles all chain complexity
- User sees yields, not gas fees
- Capital flows to best risk-adjusted returns

**4. Privacy by Default**

- TEE hardware isolation
- Homomorphic encryption (future)
- Anonymous publishing
- Zero personal data collection

**5. Economic Sovereignty**

- Non-custodial vaults (users own shares)
- Passkey authentication (biometric, no seed phrases)
- Multi-chain key management in TEE
- Users control capital, agents execute strategies

---

## XI. Competitive Moats

### Why Big Tech Can't Replicate This

**1. Economic Model Inversion**

OpenAI/Anthropic extract via subscriptions ($20/month). Choir pays users for contributions.

Switching their model would:

- Invalidate current valuations
- Require new revenue sources
- Conflict with training data extraction
- Cannibalize existing subscriptions

**2. Privacy Architecture**

Google/Apple/Meta require data access for ads and training. Choir's entire model requires privacy (TEE, homomorphic encryption).

They cannot give users sovereign compute without destroying their business models.

**3. Multi-Chain Requirement**

Coinbase builds on Base (single chain). Choir requires chain agnosticism for yield optimization.

Single-chain platforms cannot offer optimal returns without contradicting their infrastructure investments.

**4. Academic Publishing Disruption**

Elsevier/Springer extract billions from paywalls. Choir offers immediate publication with economic rewards.

Traditional publishers cannot adopt rapid publication and citation economics without destroying their journal prestige model.

### First-Mover Advantages

**IP Accumulation**: Early researchers claim foundational concepts, earn citations indefinitely

**Citation Networks**: Compound value through reference chains (power law distribution)

**Token Distribution**: Novelty rewards front-load to early users (decreasing emissions)

**Treasury Growth**: Protocol accumulates assets from split decisions, ecosystem investments

**Network Effects**: More users → More research → Better yields → More capital → More citations

---

## XII. Success Metrics (Falsifiable)

### Economic Claims

- ✅ **Citation rewards > $X/month** (verify on-chain, stablecoin transfers)
- ✅ **Yield farming APY = 10-15%** (verify via Blend/Aave/Morpho on-chain data)
- ✅ **Performance fee split = 70/20/10** (verify in smart contracts)
- ✅ **Token buyback volume** (verify on-chain, Sui DEX data)

### Growth Metrics

**Month 1-3**:

- 1,000+ users (Vibewriter trials)
- 100+ articles published
- First citations recorded
- $10K+ in vaults (early adopters)

**Month 3-6**:

- 10,000+ users
- 500+ articles
- Citation rewards > $1K/month total
- $100K+ in vaults

**Month 6-12**:

- 100,000+ users
- 2,000+ articles
- Citation rewards > $10K/month
- $1M+ TVL across chains
- Multi-chain expansion live

**Year 2**:

- 1,000,000+ users
- 10,000+ published articles
- Citation rewards > $100K/month
- $10M+ TVL
- Governance transition begins

### Quality Signals

- **Temporal validation**: Citations 3+ months after publication (enduring value)
- **Revision acceptance rate**: Quality of collaborative improvements
- **Treasury accumulation**: Growth from split decisions (sustainable funding)
- **Citation velocity**: Citations per article per month (engagement depth)

---

## XIII. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Q4 2025)

- 🚧 Custom `SandboxBackendProtocol` for Deep Agent ↔ MicroVM integration
- 🚧 Integrate the three core Choir tools (`search_choir_kb`, `cite_article`, `publish_to_choir`)
- 🚧 Establish the two-currency economic model (USDC for citations, CHIP for novelty/publishing)

**Publishing Infrastructure**:

- 🚧 Anonymous publishing routes using wallet signatures
- 🚧 Staking CHIP to publish and influence discovery
- 🚧 Foundational citation graph and visualization

**Data & Communication**:

## XIV. Conclusion: The Learning Economy

### The Vision

Intelligence that creates value should share in that value.

**For researchers**: Publish work, get cited, earn income. No capital required.

**For investors**: Deploy capital, agents cite research, fund the ecosystem. Optional advanced feature.

**For everyone**: Ideas that matter generate measurable economic returns. Merit over status. Rapid iteration over institutional gatekeeping. Economic rewards over prestige games.

### The Opportunity

When AI achieves "Move 37" breakthroughs across every field, traditional academic publishing becomes a bottleneck. We need infrastructure for:

- Rapid publication (not 18-month review)
- Merit-based evaluation (not credential verification)
- Economic rewards (not prestige hierarchies)
- Anonymous contribution (not institutional gatekeeping)
- Collaborative improvement (not static publications)

**Choir is that infrastructure.**

### The Moat

Not better execution on existing models. **New infrastructure incumbents cannot replicate.**

- Economic inversion (pay users, not extract subscriptions)
- Privacy architecture (TEE, homomorphic encryption)
- Multi-chain requirement (yield optimization)
- Academic disruption (rapid publication + economic rewards)

### The Gradient

Enter at your trust level:

- **Try Vibewriter** (zero risk, immediate value)
- **Publish research** (time investment, citation income)
- **Deploy capital** (financial risk, compound returns)

Most users never progress beyond research. That's the design. Finance capitalizes the system but isn't required for participation or profit.

### Your Ideas Make AI Smarter

When AI makes money, you should too.

**Choir: The Thought Bank**

The citation economy doesn’t care what form the contribution takes. Writing is the entry point—the most legible form of thought. But eventually: code that earns citations, organizational knowledge that earns citations, any novel contribution that others find valuable enough to reference.

## Appendix: The Intellectual vs. Academic Distinction

### Academic Publishing

- **Gatekeeping**: Institutional affiliation required
- **Slow**: 18-month peer review cycles
- **Exploitative**: Authors unpaid, publishers extract billions
- **Credential-based**: CV matters more than ideas
- **Static**: No mechanism for improvement post-publication
- **Prestige-driven**: Journal ranking determines distribution

### Intellectual Publishing (Choir)

- **Merit-based**: Anonymous submission, economic signals
- **Rapid**: Instant publication, immediate citations
- **Rewarding**: Citation income from real value creation
- **Idea-based**: Quality determines distribution, not credentials
- **Dynamic**: Revision markets enable ongoing improvement
- **Economics-driven**: Value determines visibility, not prestige

**The difference**: Academia exploits junior scholars and gatekeeps based on status. Choir rewards genuine insight and enables anyone to participate based on merit.

When AI makes breakthroughs faster than peer review can process them, the intellectual model wins. Infrastructure for thought at the speed of intelligence.
